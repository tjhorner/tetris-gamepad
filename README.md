# Tetris Gamepad

Source files for an arcade-style gamepad meant to be used for Tetris gameplay. Work in progress.

## Directory Structure

- `src`: Source files for the firmware (licensed under MIT)
- `design`: PCB and enclosure design files (licensed under CC-BY-SA 4.0)
  - **Note:** The KiCad files may require you to install the [DigiKey library](https://forum.digikey.com/t/importing-the-digi-key-kicad-library-into-kicad-5-0-0/4075)

## Firmware

There are a few modes planned for the gamepad firmware:

- Bluetooth gamepad
- Bluetooth keyboard
- Switch Pro Controller emulation

I'm not currently planning on adding wired support.
