# Tetris Gamepad

These are the source files for an arcade-style gamepad designed to be used for Tetris gameplay. Work in progress (things will break!)

## Directory Structure

- `src`: Source files for the firmware (licensed under MIT)
- `design`: PCB and enclosure design files (licensed under CC-BY-SA 4.0)
  - **Note:** The KiCad files may require you to install the [DigiKey library](https://forum.digikey.com/t/importing-the-digi-key-kicad-library-into-kicad-5-0-0/4075)

## Hardware

**License:** CC-BY-SA 4.0

This project is intended to be used with the [Adafruit HUZZAH32](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405) board (mostly because that's what I had lying around), but with minor tweaks could be modified to use any ESP32 board, or even a raw ESP32 chip. The design is pretty simple; it just uses the GPIO pins in either `INPUT_PULLUP` mode (for the button inputs) or `OUTPUT` mode (for the button LEDs). Since it uses the `INPUT_PULLUP` mode, and the button LEDs have an inbuilt 200ohm resistor, no additional resistors are required.

If you want to build one yourself, here are the components you will need:

- 1x [Adafruit HUZZAH32](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405)
- 8x [Arcade Button](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3491) (get creative with the colors!)
- 16x [Arcade Button Quick Connect Wire Pairs](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1152)
- 16x [B2B-XH-A JST Connector](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/jst-sales-america-inc/B2B-XH-A-LF-SN/)

You can find the KiCad files for the PCB design in the `design/pcb` directory, or if you want to quickly order some, here's a fancy button that will take you to the OSH Park page for the project:

## Enclosure

**License:** CC-BY-SA 4.0

The enclosure is a pretty simple box with fingers to assemble it, generated by [MakerCase](https://en.makercase.com/). There are holes in the top of the box that should fit the buttons snugly, along with some engravings near the buttons to indicate what they're for.

You can find the design files for the enclosure in the `design/enclosure` directory if you want to cut one out yourself.

## Firmware

**License:** MIT

The firmware development workflow is powered by [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/), so you will need to get that set up if you want to modify or flash the firmware. All the dependencies are listed in the `platformio.ini` file so you shouldn't need to download anything manually.

### Operating Modes

There are a few modes planned for the gamepad firmware:

- [x] Bluetooth gamepad
- [x] Bluetooth keyboard
- [ ] Switch Pro Controller emulation

I'm not currently planning on adding wired support, since that would require either separate hardware or modifying the bootloader.

The mode you are currently in will be indicated by how many times the startup animation loops (one cycle of the startup animation is all the LEDs turning on in order, then turning off).

- 1 time: gamepad mode
- 2 times: keyboard mode
- 3 times: Switch Pro Controller mode

You can switch between the modes by holding down a certain button during startup:

- HOLD: Switch to gamepad mode
- CCW: Switch to keyboard mode
- CW: Switch to Pro Controller mode (currently does nothing!)

The default is gamepad mode. It will remember what mode you last selected on startup, so you don't need to hold the button down every time.

### Configuration

If you want to modify which pins correspond to which buttons, you can do that in the `config.h` file. For convenience, `pins.h` defines a list of which JST connectors (labeled on the PCB) correspond to which GPIO pins (you can also modify this if need be).

You can also change which buttons you need to press to switch between modes.
